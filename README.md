# Pokemon-Themed Pong Game 🎯🐲

Welcome to the Pong game – a two-dimensional sports simulation that brings the classic table tennis experience with a Pokémon twist. In this game, players control paddles on the left and right sides of the screen, aiming to hit a Pokémon ball back and forth. The goal is to reach eleven points before the opponent, scoring each time the opponent fails to return the ball.
